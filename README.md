# Echo-Essentials
Echo Essentials published by Packt.  This repository holds the sample code that
is used within the Echo Essentials book.  The code has been broken down into 
per chapter samples, which come directly from the book.

## Usage

The following instructions assume you have downloaded and installed Go, as
well as setup your $GOPATH environment variable.  Instructions for these tasks
are found in the first chapter of the book.

The instructions also assume you know how to use `git` distributed version
control tool.

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/PacktPublishing
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/PacktPublishing
git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Echo-Essentials
cd Echo-Essentials/
```

These instructions will download all of the sample code, organized by chapter
that is used within the book.  Each chapter directory is a completely
independent Go package, which includes vendor code which is known to work with
the examples.
